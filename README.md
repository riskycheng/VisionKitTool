# VisionKitTool

## Overview

VisionKitTool is an iOS application designed to explore and demonstrate Apple's Vision framework capabilities for image processing and computer vision tasks. This tool serves as an experimental platform for investigating cutting-edge imaging technologies available in iOS.

## Features

### Current Capabilities

- **Person Segmentation**: Precisely isolate people from images with transparent backgrounds
  - Uses `VNGeneratePersonSegmentationRequest` with high-quality settings
  - Provides clean edge detection and background removal
  - Similar to the "Subject Lift" feature in iOS Photos app

- **Object Segmentation**: Detect and isolate prominent objects in images
  - Uses `VNGenerateObjectnessBasedSaliencyImageRequest` for object detection
  - Creates masks based on detected object boundaries
  - Extracts objects with transparent backgrounds

### User Interface

- Simple, intuitive interface for selecting and processing images
- Segmentation type selector (Person/Object)
- Real-time processing with progress indicators
- Error handling and user feedback
- Side-by-side comparison of original and processed images

## Technical Implementation

- Built with SwiftUI for modern, responsive UI
- Leverages Vision framework for image analysis and segmentation
- Uses Core Image for advanced image processing
- Implements custom pixel-level processing for high-quality results
- Optimized for performance with background processing

## System Requirements

### Hardware Requirements

- Compatible with iPhone and iPad
- Requires iOS 16.0 or later
- Best performance on devices with A12 Bionic chip or newer
- Neural Engine recommended for optimal processing speed

### Software Dependencies

- Swift 5.0+
- Vision framework
- Core Image framework
- PhotosUI for image selection

## Future Enhancements

The VisionKitTool project is actively being developed with plans to incorporate additional Vision framework capabilities:

- Multi-person segmentation with individual masks
- Animal and pet detection/segmentation
- Scene classification and analysis
- Face and facial feature detection
- Text recognition and document scanning
- Hand and body pose estimation
- 3D object reconstruction
- Integration with ARKit for augmented reality applications

## Privacy Considerations

- The app requires permission to access the photo library
- All processing is performed on-device; no data is transmitted externally
- Adheres to Apple's privacy guidelines for photo and camera access

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in Xcode 14 or later
3. Build and run on a compatible iOS device or simulator
4. Grant photo library access when prompted
5. Select an image and choose a segmentation type
6. View the processed result with transparent background
